Hi! I'm still a newbie but interested in Learning Programming and Coding.
From Mexico, speak English, Japanese and Spanish.

Here, the fields I'm currently working on:
-Image Processing
-Computer Vision
-Web Development (Front End and Back End Development)

I want to learn mobile development with Flutter but not yet started formally learning it.

Somehow, I can write in Python, C, C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript, MySQL, SQL and PHP.
There are a lot of things to learn! So let me help you, or try!
